# Fuzzy Tools ðŸ”§
This is repository full of python functions, classes, methods, etc, that I've used along my adventure with Machine Learning, Data Science and programming in general.
Some of the uses are:
- strings, list, dicts, console prints methods
- progress bars
- pickle-files methods
- custom plots and colors
- basic data methods
- email utils
- jupyter-notebook
- latex tables methods

This is a very personal and experimental library, so use it with caution.
If, for any odd reason, you are using this repo, then please report any bugs.
